# Authentication Introduction

## Overview

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It
is a critical component in securing applications and services. By ensuring that
only authenticated users can access certain resources, you can protect sensitive
data and functionalities from unauthorized access.

### Common Authentication Methods

1. **Password-Based Authentication**: Users provide a username and password.
2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Uses multiple credentials (e.g.,
   password and security token).
3. **Token-Based Authentication**: Manages user sessions with tokens like JWTs.
4. **OAuth**: Grants limited access to user information without exposing
   passwords.
5. **Passport.js**: Middleware for Node.js that supports various authentication
   strategies.

### Importance of Authentication

- **Security**: Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- **Integrity**: Ensures that users are who they claim to be.
- **User Trust**: Builds confidence in the security of your application.

### Next Steps

After understanding the basics of authentication, the next step is to explore
various authentication mechanisms in detail. The following sections will cover:

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**
- **Passport.js**
- **OAuth**

Each section will include hands-on examples and detailed explanations to help
you implement and understand these authentication methods effectively.

# Authentication Overview

## What is Authentication?

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It
ensures that users are who they claim to be before granting access to resources.

## Authentication vs. Authorization

- **Authentication**: Confirms the user's identity (e.g., logging in with a
  username and password).
- **Authorization**: Determines what resources a user can access after
  authentication (e.g., access control lists, roles).

## Common Authentication Methods

1. **Password-Based Authentication**

   - Users provide a username and password.
   - Common but prone to security risks if not implemented correctly.

2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

   - Requires multiple forms of verification (e.g., password and a code sent to
     a mobile device).
   - Enhances security by adding an extra layer of verification.

3. **Token-Based Authentication**

   - Users receive a token (e.g., JWT) after successfully logging in.
   - Tokens are used for subsequent requests, eliminating the need to re-enter
     credentials.

4. **Biometric Authentication**

   - Uses physical characteristics (e.g., fingerprint, facial recognition) to
     verify identity.
   - Provides a high level of security but requires specialized hardware.

5. **OAuth and OpenID Connect**
   - Protocols for third-party authentication.
   - Allow users to authenticate using their accounts on other platforms (e.g.,
     Google, Facebook).

## Importance of Authentication

- **Security**: Protects sensitive data and resources from unauthorized access.
- **User Accountability**: Ensures that actions can be traced back to the
  authenticated user.
- **Access Control**: Enables fine-grained control over who can access different
  parts of the system.

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Understanding Authentication

1. **Explain Authentication vs. Authorization**:

   - Write a short explanation differentiating authentication and authorization.

2. **Common Authentication Methods**:

   - List and briefly describe at least three common methods of authentication.

3. **Importance of Authentication**:
   - Provide three reasons why authentication is crucial in web applications.

### Challenge 2: Common Authentication Methods

1. **Password-Based Authentication**:

   - Describe how it works and its common vulnerabilities.

2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:

   - Explain the concept and give an example of how it is implemented.

3. **Token-Based Authentication**:

   - Define what a token is and how it is used in subsequent requests after
     initial login.

4. **Biometric Authentication**:

   - Explain the basics of biometric authentication and provide an example.

5. **OAuth and OpenID Connect**:
   - Describe how these protocols work for third-party authentication.

### Challenge 3: Importance of Authentication

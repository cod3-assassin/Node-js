Introduction to Passport.js Passport.js is a popular middleware for Node.js that
simplifies the process of implementing authentication in web applications. It is
designed to be flexible and modular, supporting various authentication
strategies.

Key Features of Passport.js Strategy-Based: Passport.js uses a strategy-based
approach, allowing you to integrate multiple authentication methods easily, such
as local authentication, OAuth, and more. Middleware: It works seamlessly with
Express.js and other middleware frameworks, providing a simple and consistent
interface for authentication. User Sessions: Passport.js supports persistent
login sessions, making it easy to handle user sessions and maintain user
authentication state. Extensible: With over 500 community-contributed
strategies, you can find a strategy for almost any authentication provider or
implement your own. How Passport.js Works Configuration: You configure
Passport.js by specifying which authentication strategies to use and how to
serialize and deserialize user information. Authentication Requests: When a user
attempts to log in, Passport.js handles the authentication request using the
configured strategies. User Sessions: Once authenticated, Passport.js can manage
user sessions, keeping the user logged in across multiple requests. Protected
Routes: You can protect routes in your application by requiring users to be
authenticated using Passport.js middleware.

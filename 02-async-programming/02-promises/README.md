Promises provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations compared to
callbacks. They have three states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected. Promises
can be chained with .then() for handling successful completions and .catch() for
handling errors. util.promisify can convert callback-based functions to
promise-based functions. Promise.all and Promise.race are useful for handling
multiple promises concurrently.

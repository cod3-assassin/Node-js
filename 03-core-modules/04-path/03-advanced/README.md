# Node.js Path Module - Advanced Concepts

This document explores advanced concepts in the Node.js `path` module.

## 01 - Converting a Path to a URL

The `path.toFileURL()` method converts a given path to a file URL. This is
useful for working with URLs in web-related applications or when interoperating
with modules that expect file URLs.

### Use Cases:

- **Web Applications:** Generating file URLs for resources served over HTTP.
- **Module Interoperability:** Providing file URLs as inputs to modules.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Ensuring consistent URL formatting.

## 02 - Converting a URL to a Path

The `path.fromFileURL()` method converts a file URL to a path. This is helpful
when dealing with file URLs received from external sources or when parsing URLs
in web-related applications.

### Use Cases:

- **Web Applications:** Handling file URLs received from client requests.
- **Module Interoperability:** Parsing file URLs when working with modules.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Ensuring consistent path representation.

## 03 - Implementing a Custom Path Resolver

Node.js allows you to implement custom path resolvers to extend or override the
default behavior of path resolution. This is useful in scenarios where you need
to handle path resolution in a specific way not covered by built-in methods.

### Use Cases:

- **Remote File Access:** Fetching files from remote storage services.
- **Virtual File Systems:** Handling paths for virtual or in-memory file
  systems.
- **Custom URL Handling:** Resolving URLs to retrieve resources from external
  sources.

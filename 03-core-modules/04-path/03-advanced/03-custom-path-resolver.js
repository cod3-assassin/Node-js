// Custom path resolver function
function resolvePath(filePath) {
  // Your custom logic to resolve the filePath
  // For example, fetching the file from a remote storage service
  // and returning a local path or buffer representing the file
}

// Usage example
const resolvedPath = resolvePath("/remote-files/example.txt");
console.log("Resolved Path:", resolvedPath);

// The resolvePath() function represents your custom path resolver.
// Inside the function, you implement the logic to resolve the given filePath to the actual file content or location based on your application's requirements.
// This approach allows you to seamlessly integrate custom path resolution logic into your Node.js application, enabling you to work with files stored in remote locations or handle path resolution in specialized scenarios.
// Use Cases:
// Remote File Access: Fetching files from remote storage services like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage.
// Virtual File Systems: Handling paths for virtual file systems or in-memory file systems.
// Custom URL Handling: Resolving URLs to retrieve resources from external sources.
// Implementing a custom path resolver provides flexibility and control over path resolution in your Node.js applications, allowing you to adapt to various scenarios and requirements.
